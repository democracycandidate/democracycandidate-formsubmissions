A current Board Member for Roselle School District 12, Quinn pairs deep local roots with proven leadership, fiscal responsibility, and vast ecological knowledge. He earned his Eagle Scout rank with Medinah Troop 95 and graduated from the University of Wisconsin - Stevens Point with a degree in Wildlife Ecology. With over a decade of experience in habitat management specializing in native bird conservation, Quinn is a hands-on leader and dedicated environmentalist. In his free time, Quinn mentors high school students through Lake Park High School’s Earth Club, where he guides restoration projects, grows and protects endangered native plants, and shares his passion with the next generation. He also volunteers with the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors to rescue injured birds, and with the Roselle Park District in their ongoing habitat restorations. Quinn has successfully received funding for research through grant programs through UWSP and thus has a full understanding of how to strategically allocate funds to specific priorities such as resource management and onsite field data collection. Quinn Fulmer’s combination of professional expertise, dedication to community service, and unwavering commitment to native species restoration make him uniquely qualified to serve as Forest Preserve Commissioner, where he can aid in the Forest Preserve’s mission to ensure our natural areas thrive for generations to come."

### Policy
We must invest wisely in habitat restoration, invasive species control, dam removals, and ecological resilience against climate stress. I bring direct ecological experience to identify priorities, ensure accountability, and measure success with field data. I will strengthen our ability to respond to emergent threats, from flooding to invasive pests, and champion the expansion of green corridors for wildlife.

DuPage County faces financial pressure. The Forest Preserve has floated tax increases to sustain operations. While voters in 2024 supported a modest increase, we cannot rely on raising taxes indefinitely. I will prioritize cost efficiency, zero-based review of line items, and innovative revenue sources (such as grants, partnerships, and philanthropic support) to deliver essential services and protect our open spaces without burdening taxpayers.

My commitment to fiscal responsibility is matched by a commitment to openness. Every dollar will be tracked, and every project justified. I’ll set clear performance targets (e.g. acres restored per year, trail repair goals, emergency response timelines) and publicly report progress at regular intervals.

Our trails, bridges, washrooms, parking lots, and signage must be safe, well maintained, and climate resilient. I’ll advocate for capital investments that deliver long lifespans and low maintenance costs, prioritizing high-use areas, access for all, and public safety enhancements like better lighting, surveillance, and trail connectivity.

Land is not just to be protected — it’s to be loved and understood. I will expand partnerships with local schools, Earth Clubs, and volunteer programs to bring hands-on conservation learning into our community. I will increase public transparency through open data dashboards, regular reporting on ecological metrics (wildlife indicators, water quality, habitat acreage restored), and community oversight of major projects.

### Experience
As a wildlife ecologist and former Eagle Scout, I’ve led habitat restorations, bird conservation work, and field research. I know what it takes — scientifically and practically — to nurture resilient ecosystems. In my role as a Board Member of Roselle School District 12 and my volunteer work, I’ve managed budgets, built consensus, and delivered results. I want to bring that same disciplined leadership to the DuPage Forest Preserve.
